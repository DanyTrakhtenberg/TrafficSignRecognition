# TrafficSignRecognition
Detecting stop, yield and roundabout  signs using color and shape detection
This is a project that i made when i was a CS student
The purpose ws to make as a simple way to detect roud sign without using any machin learning algorithms
This is not an optimized program and can be in the future
